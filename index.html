        <p>My name is Kevin Martin, a 25 year old resident of Seattle. I was born in Chicago and moved to Washington State when I was about a year old. I've spent most of my life in Eastern Washington and recently moved to Seattle after graduating from Washington State University in the Spring of 2017. After completing this course I am planning to get a job involving web development while continuing to develop my tech skills. IoT and Machine Learning technologies are especially exciting to me and I eventually want to either work for or start a company that uses these concepts in innovative ways. </p>
        
        <p>One of my lifelong passions has always been baseball. Growing up it was my favorite sport to play, and as I have grown older and stopped playing, it has remained my favorite sport to follow and watch. My favorite team is the New York Yankees and I have been to over 20 MLB stadiums in my lifetime. My dad and I bonded while I was growing up over our love of collecting baseball cards, which led to us amassing a large collection filled with autographed, rookie, and relic cards. </p>

        <p>When I am not learning to code or watching baseball I keep myself occupied in a variety of ways. Some of my favorite video games at the moment are Overwatch, H1Z1, God of War, and many others. I am especially excited for Red Dead Redemption 2 to come out! I also enjoying reading, writing, and dominating my league in fantasy football. And if I get a chance to, I love visiting the family's lake house for a few days of rest and relaxation. </p>
